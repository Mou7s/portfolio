## Introduction

A Hackintosh is a non-Apple computer running macOS. In this guide, you will learn a fast and practical workflow for installing macOS on PC hardware using [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).

## Prerequisites

1. You need a Windows PC.
   *For the best [Hardware-Sniffer](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/Hardware-Sniffer) experience, use Windows.*
2. The PC must be connected to the internet.
3. Python must be installed on this PC.
4. You need a USB drive.
5. Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/#download).
6. Download [OpCore-Simplify](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify).
7. Download [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).  
   *In this workflow, you only need the `macrecovery` tool from OpenCore.*
8. Keep in mind that the most reliable approach is still to build your EFI manually by following [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). EFI files generated by tools like OpCore-Simplify may not be perfect for every machine. If you want a faster and more general workflow, set aside about one hour and let's get started.


## Installation Process

1. Create the USB drive
   1. Use Rufus to prepare the USB drive.
   2. In `Device`, select your USB drive.
   3. In `Boot selection`, choose `Non bootable`.
   4. In `Partition scheme`, choose `GPT`.
   5. Keep other settings at their default values, then click `START`.
2. Generate the EFI
   1. Open the downloaded OpCore-Simplify folder and run `OpCore-Simplify.bat`.
   2. Select `Select Hardware Report`.
   3. Enter `e` to generate a hardware report for your current machine. Use this report to check whether your device is suitable for Hackintosh.
   4. If the hardware report indicates support, select `Build OpenCore EFI`. Choose the macOS version you want to install, and OpCore-Simplify will generate an EFI for you.
   5. After generation is complete, the EFI folder opens automatically. Copy the `EFI` folder to the root directory of your USB drive.
3. Download macOS recovery files
   1. Open the downloaded OpenCore folder and go to `Utilities/macrecovery`.
   2. Choose the command for your target macOS version based on [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/windows-install.html#downloading-macos).
   3. Run the command to download macOS recovery files.
   4. Copy the generated `com.apple.recovery.boot` folder to the root directory of your USB drive.
4. Configure BIOS settings
   1. Adjust your motherboard BIOS settings according to [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).
   2. Required settings vary by motherboard series, so use Dortania's documentation as the source of truth.
   3. For AMD platforms, refer to [Ryzen and Threadripper (17h and 19h)](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/AMD/zen.html#amd-bios-settings).
5. Install macOS
   1. Boot from the USB drive to launch OpenCore.
   2. Start the macOS installation process and complete setup.
