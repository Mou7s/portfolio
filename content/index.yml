    - title: Services & Process
      questions:
        - label: What services do you offer?
          content: |
            I design and build end-to-end web experiences. That means UX research, visual systems, Nuxt/Vue front-end engineering, API development, and deployment to cloud or on-prem infrastructure. Because of my IT and networking background, I can also take care of hosting setups, observability, and light DevOps so your product is stable after launch.
        - label: What is your design process like?
          content: |
            I kick things off with discovery sessions to map user goals and technical constraints, then move into low/high-fidelity prototypes before coding. Development happens in tight feedback loops with QA checklists, performance passes, and handover documentation so teams always know the state of the build.
        - label: Do you work with startups?
          content: |
            Absolutely—I thrive in early-stage environments where roles are fluid. I can help founders translate vague ideas into scoped roadmaps, stand up MVPs quickly, and harden the stack as traction grows, all while staying mindful of budget and time.
    - title: Pricing & Timelines
      questions:
        - label: How much does a project typically cost?
          content: |
            Budgets vary by scope, integrations, and infrastructure needs. Full-stack engagements that include design, development, and deployment usually start around $6,000 and scale toward $20,000+ for multi-surface platforms. I’m happy to break work into phases if that fits your cash flow better.
        - label: What are your payment terms?
          content: |
            I typically request 35% upfront to reserve the slot, 35% at the midpoint milestone, and the remaining 30% upon delivery. For retainers or ops support we can switch to a monthly invoice after the first engagement.
        - label: How long does a typical project take?
          content: |
            Small marketing sites and integrations usually ship in 3-4 weeks. Complex dashboards, API work, or deployments that require infrastructure coordination take 6-10 weeks. I provide a milestone schedule after discovery so you know exactly what happens when.
        - label: Do you offer retainers or ongoing support?
          content: |
            Yes. Many teams keep me on for incremental features, reliability work, or network maintenance. Retainers can cover a set amount of hours or be structured around specific deliverables—we’ll tailor it to your roadmap.
    - title: About Me
      questions:
        - label: What do you enjoy most about your work?
          content: |
            I love connecting the dots between product strategy, clean design, and resilient engineering. Turning messy specs into something elegant and reliable—and watching users succeed with it—is what keeps me energized.
        - label: What are your hobbies outside of work?
          content: |
            When I'm off the clock in Dongguan, I unwind by taking mountain drives, hiking local peaks, and squeezing in badminton matches.
            Piano practice and long music sessions help me reset before the next round of product work.
