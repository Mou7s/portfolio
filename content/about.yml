  Hi, I’m Liu Chuge, a full-stack engineer focused on building digital products and websites end to end. Over the past few years, I’ve been deeply involved in creating experiences that are not only stable and functional, but also intuitive, smooth, and genuinely enjoyable for users.

  My journey began at Guangdong Peizheng College, where I earned a degree in Advertising. That academic background gave me a solid foundation in visual communication and understanding user needs. At the same time, I spent my free time learning front-end development, bringing my interest in creativity and design into real-world implementation through code. Since then, I’ve continued to refine both sides, believing that great digital products come from a unified understanding of aesthetics, usability, and reliable execution.

  ### My Design Philosophy

  I use user insights from my advertising background to set the direction, rely on my full-stack skills to ensure solid execution, and tie design and engineering into one rope to create digital experiences that are both intuitive and reliable.

  ### What Drives Me

  What keeps me motivated is the sense of achievement that comes from solving real problems well and making products feel smoother and more effortless to use. I enjoy learning continuously through frontline business needs—picking up new technologies and better ways to communicate—then breaking complex requirements down into clear, executable solutions.

  For me, the most meaningful moments are when I take something from an idea to design, development, deployment, and ongoing operation, and then see it running reliably in the real world and being used smoothly by people. Whether it’s refining a small interaction detail, improving performance, or strengthening consistency across the experience, if it helps users take one fewer wrong turn and feel more comfortable using the product, I know the work is worth it.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm off the clock in Dongguan, I unwind by taking mountain drives, hiking peaks, and squeezing in badminton matches.

  Piano practice and long music sessions help me reset before the next round of product work.
